“Who Can Vote?” is the 2012 project of News21, a national investigative reporting project funded by the Carnegie Corporation of New York and the John S. and James L. Knight Foundation.

I was asked asked to design a serious website and worked on everything from the wireframing to templating all the different types of stories and interactives in Armstrong.

**Tools:** HTML5/CSS3, jQuery, Photoshop, Armstrong/Django
